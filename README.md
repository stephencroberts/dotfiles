# Dotfiles

My macOS/Linux dotfiles

## Installation

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL http://go.stephenroberts.io/dotfiles)"
```

## Overview

These dotfiles are designed to be used anywhere, even alpine linux as I often do
work in long-running containers, and they are extremely easy to install. A slick
CLI interface (see more below) presents a list of self-contained and
cross-platform modules that can be installed; everything from GUI applications
to CLI tools and OS preferences.

A huge thanks goes to Ben Alman and his
[dotfiles](https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles) for getting me started and for
creating the CLI interface I use. I have since rewritten every single line of
code from my original fork in 2015.
