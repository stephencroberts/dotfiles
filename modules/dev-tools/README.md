## GNU Global

GNU Global uses Universal Ctags as the engine and the native vim integration
with gtags and cscope. The design includes the following features:

- git hooks to automatically generate gtags
- integration with mise to allow other plugins to specify gtag database search
  paths (see node and ruby modules)
- ability to ignore patterns

### Ignore patterns

The list of files indexed by gtags is generated by listing the tracked git
files, and patterns can be excluded by setting `GTAGS_EXCLUDE`:

```sh
export GTAGS_EXCLUDE=":!:public :!:db :!:bin :!:package*"
```

This uses pathspec with `git ls-files`, for example: `git ls-files -- .
':!:*.log'`.

It's recommended to set the environment variable in the `.envrc` file in the
project.

### Libs

`gtags` can be configured to load multiple databases by searching
`GTAGSLIBPATH`. `mise-dotfiles.sh` is configured to search for nested `GTAGS`
files in the project with a default max search depth of 5 which can be
configured by setting `GTAGS_MAX_DEPTH` per-project.

### Integrations

Nested libs work in conjunction with other ways of generating those databases,
for instance when `npm install` is executed to generate a database for
`node_modules`.
