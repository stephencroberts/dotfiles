## GNU Global

GNU Global uses Universal Ctags as the engine and the native vim integration
with gtags and cscope. The design includes the following features:

- git hooks to automatically generate gtags
- integration with direnv to allow other plugins to specify gtag database search
  paths (see node and ruby modules)
- ability to ignore patterns

### Ignore patterns

The list of files indexed by gtags is generated by listing the tracked git
files, and patterns can be excluded by setting `GTAGS_EXCLUDE`:

```sh
export GTAGS_EXCLUDE=":!:public :!:db :!:bin :!:package*"
```

This uses pathspec with `git ls-files`, for example: `git ls-files -- .
':!:*.log'`.

It's recommended to set the environment variable in the `.envrc` file in the
project.

### Integrations

The integration between gtags and direnv works by having modules specify a
direnv script to run that should export `GTAGSLIBPATH` with a path(s) to another
gtags database. It can work in conjunction with other ways of generating those
databases, for instance when `npm install` is executed to generate a database
for `node_modules`.

## Direnv

Any time a project is cloned, a `.envrc` file is created in the project to
effectively enable direnv which will run the dir lib scripts that are used for
the integrations.
